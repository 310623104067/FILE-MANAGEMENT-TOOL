C++ provides the <fstream> library, which contains ofstream (output file stream) → for writing to files.
ifstream (input file stream) → for reading from files.
fstream (file stream) → for both reading and writing.
Use ofstream to write data to a file. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.
Use ifstream to read data from a file.
Use ofstream with std::ios::app mode to append data to an existing file.
